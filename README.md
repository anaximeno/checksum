# CHECKSUM

Checksum is a **terminal program** made in python that check the integrity of one file by comparing the file hash to the given hash.

### How does it work?
 * It convert the file to the hash chosen and compares it with the given hash

### Usage:
  > checksum "*type_of_check*" "*file_path*" "*original_sum*"

Types of hash that you can currently use:
 - md5
 - sha1
 - sha224
 - sha256
 - sha384
 - sha512

If you are in the file_to_be_checked's path you can just write the file's file_name

In file/hash sum you can use an file(.txt) that currently has the sum or the sum code itself

**This program is in tests currently, if you have suggestion let me know ;), if you want to contribute go ahead!**

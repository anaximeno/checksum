# Integrity checker

The objective is to make an open source terminal program (in shell script) and graphical program to check the integrity of the hash
of one file.

It uses python to make the checks and converts the file to especifics types of hashes. The program convert the file
to the hash chosen and compare it with the original sum hash that is given where you downloaded the file.


Usage:
  checksum [type_of_check] [file_path]  [original_sum]

Types of hash that you can currently use: <br>
  md5<br>
  sha1<br>
  sha224<br>
  sha256<br>
  sha384<br>
  sha512<br>

*If you are in the file_to_be_checked's path you can just write the file's file_name

*In [file/hash sum] you can use an file(.txt) that currently has the sum or the sum code itself

I am improving the codes currently if you have any suggestion you can tell it to me.

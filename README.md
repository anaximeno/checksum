# Integrity checker

The objective is to make an open source terminal program (shell script) and graphical program to check the integrity of the hash
of one file.

It uses python to make the checks and converts the file to especifics types of hashes. The program convert the file
to the hash chosen and compare it with the original sum hash that is given where you downloaded the file.

Usage:
  checksum [type_of_check] [file_path]  [original_sum]

Currentlly I am testing and improving the python codes that will be used to the process of the program,
so I would like suggestions and principally help to make the bash scripts for the program.

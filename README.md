# ShaZam

ShaZam is a **CLI** application made basically in python. <br>
It checks the integrity of one file by comparing it with a given hash.

## General Information

### How does it work

It converts the file to the chosen hash type and compares it with a given hash.

### Usage & More
You can use it as below:

  > shazam *-sha1* "*file_name*" "*given_sum*"

**OBS:** If you have a file with the hashes inside you can check it by using a short command.
For more option after install it try: checksum -h/--help
  
Types of hash that you can currently use:

* md5
* sha1
* sha224
* sha256
* sha384
* sha512

**This program is in tests currently, so the build is incomplete already, <br>
